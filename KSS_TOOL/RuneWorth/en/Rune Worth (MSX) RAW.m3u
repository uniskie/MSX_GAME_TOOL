# * kbMediaplayer
#   Open the m3u or m3u8 file.
#
# * For WinAMP, please install MSXPlug.ÅB
#   (Japanese characters will be garbled, so m3u8 is recommended)
#   (Comments have been removed because m3u8 does not support comments)
#
# * For foobar2000, NPNEZ input seems to be good.
#   Foobar2000 opens kss files instead of m3u or m3u8 files.
#   (When you open a kss file, it automatically loads the m3u file with the same name.)
#   GameEmuPlayer plugins also support KSS
